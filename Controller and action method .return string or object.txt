here we have TestController as Class and Test as Controller name.
We can access any method publically by calling ControllerName.ActionName (Test/GetCustomer)
If we try to send object then its send us NameSpace.ClassName
To view object- we can override ToString() 
Actionable class can be called from outside (web or url calling)
But non actionable class cannot  be  called from the outstide world-it will give error
To make non-actionable class as public we can write as 
[NonAction]
public string SimpleMethod()
{
    return "Hi, I am not action method";
}
